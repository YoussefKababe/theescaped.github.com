Stuff that I need to mention. 

Egypt Language Use. (Wikipedia, darwish, efham platform)

Democracy is about open and public discusion, and Egypt is having it. 

Kifaya movement. 

Upon his first visit to Cairo, the late Mahmoud Darwish expressed his surprise at how everything in Cairo, from cafes to barbery shops to salons, had their signposts written 
Arabic. The whole city, in fact, was in Arabic. I believe this linguistic conformity, together with other factors I will visit shortly, make the future of Egypt a lot brighter
thant what would the distant observer conclude from recent events.
