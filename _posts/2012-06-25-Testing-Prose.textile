summary: Using Prose.io to write posts for The Escaped
---

You can access it using this link: http://prose.io/#theescaped/theescaped.github.com/master/

It will ask your permission to use your github data. From that link you can access _posts and start drafting your posts. Later I will make sure we have some defaults there so that people won't have to fill in mandane details everytime they want to publish something.
